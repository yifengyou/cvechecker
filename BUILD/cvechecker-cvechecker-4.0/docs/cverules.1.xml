    <title>Description</title>

    <para>The cverules script will scan the installed distribution packages
    on your system and attempt to generate version matching rules that can be
    used by cvechecker.</para>

    <para>The script should be used by people interested in contributing to
    the cvechecker' success.</para>

      <title>Command Usage</title>

      <para>The command requires a single option, -r. An example usage pattern
      is like so:</para>

      <programlisting>~$ cverules -r &gt; output.txt</programlisting>

      <para>The generated <filename>output.txt</filename> file can then be
      submitted to the cvechecker project, allowing it to improve the
      versions.dat.</para>
    </refsect2>

    <refsect2>
      <title>Usability</title>

      <para>The user should understand that this script attempts to generate
      matches, but doesn't guarantee that each and every installed software is
      detected.</para>

      <para>First of all, if a package is already matched by existing rules,
      the rest of the package' content isn't scanned anymore. This is because
      the tool wants to identify software and versions - once one has been
      detected, further detection is less useful and very resource
      consuming.</para>

      <para>Second, if a package isn't detected properly, the script will see
      if the version based on the distributions' package version can be found.
      If it can't, then it cannot identify the version properly and ignores
      the package.</para>

      <para>Third, if the script does find a match for the version, it tries
      out a few regular expressions (which have a high probability rate to
      match the version) but has no intelligence to optimize the expressions.
      If the tried expressions fail, the script will ignore the
      package.</para>

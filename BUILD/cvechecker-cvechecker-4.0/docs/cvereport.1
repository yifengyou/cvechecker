.SH DESCRIPTION
The cvereport tool will generate an HTML report based on the
cvechecker output. The report is generated based on some simple XML/XSLT
transformations and uses an acknowledgement file to keep track of the
state of the CVE entries matching your system.
.SH USAGE
.SS "COMMAND USAGE"
The command requires two user-specified options:
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
The \*(T<\fItargetdir\fR\*(T> is an existing, writeable
directory where cvereport can store its report.html output.
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
The acknowledgementfile is an existing, readable XML file that
contains the analysis of the CVE entries for your system
.PP
The difference between -d and -D is that
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
-d runs the standard cvechecker report, whereas
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
-D runs the cvechecker report including matches for higher
versions of the installed software
.SS "ACKNOWLEDGEMENT FILE FORMAT"
The XML file for the acknowledgements uses the following
syntax:
.PP
.nf
\*(T<<?xml version="1.0"?>
<acknowledgements>
  <resolution id="resolution_id_1">Comment about why a CVE entry is irrelevant for your system</resolution>
  <resolution id="resolution_id_2">Another comment</resolution>
  <comment id="comment_id_1">Comment why the CVE is acknowledged, but not resolved</comment>
  <file name="/path/to/filename1" cve="CVE\-2000\-1234" state="irrelevant" resolution="resolution_id_1" />
  <file name="/path/to/filename2" cve="CVE\-2000\-5678" state="irrelevant" resolution="resolution_id_2" />
  <file name="/path/to/filename3" cve="CVE\-2001\-9012" state="acknowledged" comment="comment_id_1" />
</acknowledgements>\*(T>

.PP
The use of comments or resolutions within the file entity is not
mandatory, but recommended.

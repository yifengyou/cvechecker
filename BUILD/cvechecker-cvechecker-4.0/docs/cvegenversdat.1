.SH DESCRIPTION
The cvegenversdat script is a distribution-agnostic script that
attempts to generate version matching rules for the files fed to it
through standard input. It is commonly called from a distribution-specific
script (like cverules_gentoo).
.SH USAGE
.SS "COMMAND USAGE"
The command requires the following arguments to be set:
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
packagename is the name of the package (like "gzip")
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
packageversion is the (upstream) version of the tool, not of
the distribution (so "1.4" rather than "1.4-r1" or
"1.4-yourdistro-1")
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
conffile is the cvechecker configuration file (like
"/etc/cvechecker.conf")
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
breakon (literally) tells the script to stop the moment a
match is already found within the existing cvechecker database.
Without the "breakon" string, the script will scan all passed files,
even if a few of them are already known to cvechecker.
.PP
The script should not be called by end users but is rather a
script to be called by the distribution-specific scripts like
cverules_gentoo.

    <P
>Welcome to the CVE checker user guide. The purpose of this document
    is to guide you through the installation and usage of CVE checker. But
    before we start with that, a little warning is in place...</P
>

    <P
>CVE checker does not provide security for your system. It is nothing
    more than a tool that attempts to identify installed software on your
    system and match those against the online database of CVE entries. As the
    identification of installed software depends on simple rules that are
    added by the community, it is very likely that it only detects a small
    portion of the installed software on your system (especially if you are
    running software that isn't all that popular). And even if the tool
    detects the software appropriately, it still requires that the CVE entry
    mentions this software with the same vendor and product name as this tool
    detects - if not, CVE checker will not be able to match the installed
    software against the online CVE database.</P
>

    <P
>Okay, now that that is out of the way, let's start with the CVE
    checker installation.</P

>2.2. Installation</A
></H3
>
      

      <P
>If your distribution already offers cvechecker through its package
      management system, I strongly advise that you use that. The installation
      instructions in this section assume that you do the installation
      manually (and should reflect the steps that the distribution package
      management system does for you).</P
>

      <P
>First, download the latest cvechecker package from <FONT
COLOR="RED"
>http://cvechecker.sourceforge.net</FONT
>
      (or <FONT
COLOR="RED"
>http://sourceforge.net/projects/cvechecker/files/</FONT
>),
      then extract it into a temporary directory:</P
>

      <PRE
CLASS="programlisting"
>~$ <B
CLASS="command"
>tar xvzf cvechecker-1.O.tar.gz</B
></PRE
>

      <P
>You need to select the database you want to use. cvechecker
      currently supports mysql and sqlite, and this support is enabled through
      the <B
CLASS="command"
>./configure --enable-sqlite3</B
> or
      <B
CLASS="command"
>./configure --enable-mysql</B
> options. You can select
      both too (they are not mutually exclusive) but you need to select at
      least one of them.</P
>

      <P
>Inside the extracted folder, first run
      <B
CLASS="command"
>./configure</B
> with the proper
      <B
CLASS="command"
>--enable-&#60;database&#62;</B
> options, followed by
      <B
CLASS="command"
>make</B
> and <B
CLASS="command"
>make install</B
>. If you use
      the default settings, it will install the files inside
      <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/usr/local</TT
>, so you might need root privileges to
      perform the <B
CLASS="command"
>make install</B
> step.</P
>

      <PRE
CLASS="programlisting"
>~$ <B
CLASS="command"
>cd cvechecker-1.0</B
>
~$ <B
CLASS="command"
>./configure --enable-sqlite3</B
> 
...
~$ <B
CLASS="command"
>make</B
>
...
~$ <B
CLASS="command"
>sudo -i</B
>
~# <B
CLASS="command"
>make install</B
></PRE
>

      <P
>Finally, create a group called cvechecker and change the
      permissions of the installed folders so that this group has write
      privileges inside the directory. These steps are performed when
      executing <B
CLASS="command"
>make postinstall</B
> (you almost definitely
      need root privileges now):</P
>

CLASS="section"

>2.3. Initial Configuration</A
></H3
>
      

      <P
>With the software now installed, you need to perform an initial
      configuration. This includes the setup of the databases, creation of the
      user you are going to use to run cvechecker and initial pull of the CVE
      entries from the Internet.</P
>

      <P
>First, create a user that you will use to run cvechecker. The tool
      does not require root privileges, so I recommend not to use root. I
      personally use a dedicated user whose sole purpose is to, on a daily
      basis, pull the latest updates from the Internet, generate a report and
      mail that report to me. Make sure that this user is inside the
      cvechecker group:</P
>

      <PRE
CLASS="programlisting"
>~# <B
CLASS="command"
>gpasswd -a <TT
CLASS="replaceable"
><I
>youruser</I
></TT
> cvechecker</B
></PRE
>

      <P
>Log on as that user, make sure his primary group is cvechecker and
      set the umask to 002 or higher (such as 007).</P
>

      <PRE
CLASS="programlisting"
>~# <B
CLASS="command"
>su <TT
CLASS="replaceable"
><I
>youruser</I
></TT
> -</B
>
~$ <B
CLASS="command"
>newgrp cvechecker</B
>
~$ <B
CLASS="command"
>umask 007</B
></PRE
>

      <P
>Now, initialize the databases by running <B
CLASS="command"
>cvechecker
      -i</B
>. This will create the sqlite3 databases or, if MySQL is
      selected, create the appropriate tables and indexes in the selected
      MySQL database (the tool does not create a MySQL database
      itself).</P
>

      <PRE
CLASS="programlisting"
>~$ <B
CLASS="command"
>cvechecker -i</B
></PRE
>

      <DIV
CLASS="section"
><HR><H4
CLASS="section"
><A
NAME="AEN79"
>2.3.1. Configuration File</A
></H4
>
        

        <P
>The cvechecker command uses a configuration file which it looks
        for in the users' home directory (${HOME}/.cvechecker.rc) or
        /usr/local/etc/cvechecker.conf or /etc/cvechecker.conf, in that order.
        The first configuration file that parses correctly is used, the rest
        is ignored (so there is no accumulation of configurations). Below,
        you'll find an example configuration file which shows both the sqlite3
        and mysql support:</P
>

        <PRE
CLASS="programlisting"
>#
# Generic settings
#
dbtype = "mysql";
#dbtype = "sqlite3";
cvecache = "/var/lib/cvechecker/cache";
datadir = "/usr/share/cvechecker";
stringcmd = "/usr/bin/strings -n 3 '@file@'";
version_url = "http://cvechecker.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/cvechecker/versions.dat";
#userkey = "servertag";

#
# For SQLite3
#
sqlite3: {
  localdb = "/var/lib/cvechecker/local";
  globaldb = "/var/lib/cvechecker/global.db";
};

#
# For MySQL
#
mysql: {
  dbname = "cvechecker";
  dbuser = "cvechecker_rw";
  dbpass = "passwordforcvechecker_rw";
  dbhost = "mysql.company.com";
};</PRE
>

        <P
>Most of the parameters (like cvecache, datadir, version_url and
        even localdb and globaldb) will most likely be set correctly already
        during the installation. However, it doesn't hurt to validate if the
        locations mentioned are correct and that the user that will be used to
        run cvechecker has the rights to write (to) files in the
        locations.</P

        those by running <B
CLASS="command"

        <P
>If you opt to use the MySQL database, you first need to create
        the database in your MySQL server. Installing and configuring a MySQL
        server is beyond the scope of this document. Once a database is
        created (say "cvechecker"), you can either initialize it through
        <B
CLASS="command"
>cvechecker -i</B
> (if the user you connect to the
        database to has sufficient privileges to drop and create tables and
        indexes) or use the dump file
        <TT
CLASS="filename"

        <P

        requires additional rights. When you are using cvechecker, it is
        recommended that two roles are used:</P

        <P
></P
><UL
><LI
>&#13;            <P
>A cvechecker administrative role that has the rights to load

>
          </LI
><LI
>&#13;            <P

            the matching data and read the CVE and version matching
            rules</P
>
          </LI
></UL

        <P

        <P

      earlier version of cvechecker and update the back-end accordingly. For
      sqlite3 databases, this usually isn't a problem as the tool has the
      rights to add tables and indexes when needed.</P

      <P
>However, when using MySQL databases, it is very likely that the
      user you use is not authorized to update the back-end. To fix this,
      first run cvechecker on the administrative host (where a more privileged
      MySQL account can be used). It will update the back-ends for all users
      as well. When new(er) versions are made available, we will also add the
      necessary upgrade SQL scripts to launch so that you do not have to run
      cvechecker with a database owner account.</P

    are to be scheduled on the same system. If you use MySQL however, it is
    recommended to schedule the administrative tasks on a single system (the
    "master" that is responsible for keeping the upstream data up-to-date) and
    the operational tasks on all systems where you want to run cvechecker on

        <P
>You can integrate cvechecker with your package manager, telling
        cvechecker to only add (or remove) files part of an installed (or
        uninstalled) package rather than having to feed a full file system
        listing. To do so, tell your package manager to call
        <B
CLASS="command"
>cvechecker -d -b &#60;file&#62;</B
> after each succesfull
        installation, or <B
CLASS="command"
>cvechecker -D -b &#60;file&#62;</B
>
        before a desinstallation. The -d option tells cvechecker to add the
        file content to the database (rather than replace) whereas -D tells
        cvechecker to delete those entries in the database that are also in
        the file.</P

      <P

      if, and what CPE data it detects from a specific file:</P

      <PRE
CLASS="programlisting"

      (product) from vim (vendor) versino 7.2. It was not able to deduce any

      anyway).</P

      <P
>If you want to add additional rules, make sure that the dat-file
      you will be importing contains the previous rules as well - cvechecker
      will drop all previous rules while importing new ones.</P

      <P
>The version matching rules are at the core of the
      <B
CLASS="command"
>cvechecker</B
> tool. Without them, the tool is not able
      to detect much of anything on your system. To allow you to contribute to
      the version matching rules, the project also contains a tool called
      <B
CLASS="command"
>cverules</B
>.</P
>

      <P
>The <B
CLASS="command"
>cverules</B
> command, which currently only
      supports Gentoo systems but should be easily portable towards other
      distributions or even platforms, will attempt to generate version
      matching rules for cvechecker that are currently not part of the project
      but which should give additional matches on your system.</P
>

      <P
>For instance, if cvechecker currently doesn't know how to detect
      OpenLDAP versions, but you have OpenLDAP on your system, then
      <B
CLASS="command"
>cverules</B
> might be able to deduce a (generic put
      working) expression for the version matching rules which will allow
      cvechecker to identify OpenLDAP. If you then send the output of the
      <B
CLASS="command"
>cverules</B
> to the cvechecker project, then these
      additional rules will be added to the version matching rules so that
      your next <B
CLASS="command"
>pullcves pull</B
> will pull in these additional
      rules.</P

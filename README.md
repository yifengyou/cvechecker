```
The goal of cvechecker is to report about possible vulnerabilities on your
system, by scanning a list of installed software and matching results with the
CVE database.
This is not a bullet-proof method and you will have many false positives
(i.e.: vulnerability is fixed with a revision-release, but the tool isn't able
to detect the revision itself).
